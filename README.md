# Markdown Cheatsheet
The previous line was a Header 1. This is how simple text is writen.
## And this one is Header 2
###### You can use upto Header 6.
### But the last line was so tiny to read. So, it's a good practice to use upto H3 like this line.


>After that use plain text. And this is how you create a separate block to write something.

We can also use *Italics* or **Bold** or _italics_ or ***Bold Italics*** or write same like: **_bold italics_**.

You can also write ~~Scratch~~ or <u>Underline</u>.

All the symbols of `html` can be used in markdown too!!!

You Have to create an extra line break to use the break.
Else, the current line will continue.

Represent a key or a file `like this`.
